You can either edit files or add entirely new ones here.

ABOUT EDITTING:
It doesn't matter if you want to edit something in "assets/shared/images/" or "assets/preload/images/",
you will have to put the editted files in "mods/images/", it will be handled automatically by the engine.

ABOUT SCRIPTING:
You can find all the PlayState, Main Menu, & Freeplay callbacks for lua and hscript in the "templates/" folder.
