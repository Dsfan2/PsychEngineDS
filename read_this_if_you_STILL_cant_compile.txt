If you're having trouble installing certain libraries, copy THIS Media Fire link and paste it into your web browser: 
https://www.mediafire.com/file/kpeh756hfb12r4i/UNZIP_THIS_IN_MAIN_FOLDER.zip/file

Once you download it, there should be a .zip folder called "UNZIP THIS IN MAIN FOLDER.zip"

Open it, and copy/paste the .haxelib folder you see inside, into the main directory.


IF YOU'VE NEVER COMPILED FNF ON WINDOWS BEFORE

You're gonna need to download Visual Studio Community 2019 if you haven't already:
https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads

While installing VSC, DON'T click on any of the options to install workloads. 
Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
- MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest Version)
- Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

Install these and you should be able to compile properly. :)
